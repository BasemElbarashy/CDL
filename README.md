This is a new framework to learn simples patterns from a few number of examples and use them to learn harder ones.  
The paper can be found at: arxiv..   
CDL is a library implements algorithms explaind in the paper and tested the framework on 32 small datasets

Directories included in the library:
-----------------------------------
`CDL/`   - source code  
`Dataset/`   - dataset divided into three groups (Group_A: 25 small datasets, Group_B: 5 small datasets,Group_C: 2 small datasets)  
`results/`   - MGICDs learned in all datasets and 32 animation files
