  "body": "# Common-Description Learning (CDL)\r\nThis is a new framework to learn simples patterns from a few number of examples and use them to learn complex ones. the learned models are perfectly interpretable and its depth depends on the question. What is meant by depth here is that\r\nwhenever needed, the model learns to break down the problem into simpler subproblems and solves them using previously learned models, CDL is written in C++ and tested on 32 small datasets\r\n\r\nThe paper can be found at: arxiv..   \r\n\r\n\r\nGroup_B (dataset_2): Three one-digit numbers addition\r\n---------------------\r\n![example1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BasemElbarashy/CDL/master/GifFiles/Group_B_dataset_2.gif)\r\n\r\n<br><br><br>\r\n\r\nGroup_A (dataset_19): Reverse task\r\n---------------------\r\n![example2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BasemElbarashy/CDL/master/GifFiles/Group_A_dataset_19.gif)\r\n\r\n<br><br><br>\r\n\r\nGroup_B (dataset_3)\r\n---------------------\r\n![example2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BasemElbarashy/CDL/master/GifFiles/Group_B_dataset_3.gif)\r\n\r\n<br><br><br>\r\n\r\nGroup_A (dataset_24): Comparing One Digit Numbers\r\n---------------------\r\n![example2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BasemElbarashy/CDL/master/GifFiles/Group_A_dataset_24.gif)\r\n\r\nDirectories\r\n-----------------------------------\r\n`src/`       - source files\r\n\r\n`dataset/`   - three groups of small datasets (Group_A: 25 datasets, Group_B: 5 datasets,Group_C: 2 datasets). The first line in Group_A.dat contains the number of the first dataset in the file (must be 0). The next line contains the number of training sequences followed by the training seqences. The next line conatins number of testing sequences followed by the testing sequences.   \r\n\r\n`experiments/`   \r\n* 3 outputFiles: contain MGICDs learned in each group of datasets and some details about training\r\n* 32 animation files that explain how MGICD solve the test questions, they can be shown by running `animate.py` but you need first to change the directory of the animation file in the first line in `animate.py`. You can also change the animation speed by changing the value of nodeTime (Tested on Python 3).\r\n* Most of PCDs in the outputFiles can be displayed by `visualizeCD.py`, but it need first to be copied in CD.dat\r\n\r\nInstallation on Linux\r\n---------------------\r\n```\r\n$ make\r\n$ ./runner\r\n```\r\nUsage\r\n---------------------\r\nYou can edit `Driver.cpp` to learn datasets in Group_A, Group_B or Group_C. For example, to learn the first dataset in  Group_A write this in main() function:\r\n```C++\r\n    IOH.loadDatasetsAndQuestionsFromFile(\"dataset/Group_A.dat\");\r\n    Constants::redirectStdoutToOutputFile = true;  //redirect stdout to OutputFile.txt\r\n    setHyperParameters(1,2,1,2,7,0,0,1);           //set hyperparamters for the 25 dataset in file Group_A.dat\r\n    TE.learnAndTest(0);                            //learn & test the first Dataset in file Group_A.dat\r\n```\r\nThe results and learned models will be saved in `OutputFile.txt`.\r\nTo learn all the datasets in Group_A: \r\n```C++\r\n    IOH.loadDatasetsAndQuestionsFromFile(\"dataset/Group_A.dat\");\r\n    Constants::redirectStdoutToOutputFile = true;  //redirect stdout to OutputFile.txt\r\n    setHyperParameters(1,2,1,2,7,0,0,1);           //set hyperparamters for the 25 dataset in file Group_A.dat\r\n    TE.learnAndTest();                             //learn & test all Datasets in file Group_A.dat\r\n```\r\nYou can also write a new dataset and test it but it must be formatted like other datasets\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n---------------------\r\nThis project is licensed under the terms of the MIT license\r\n",
