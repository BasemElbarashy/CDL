  "body": "# Common-Description Learning (CDL)\r\nThis is a new framework to learn simples patterns from a few number of examples and use them to learn harder ones. the learned models\r\nare perfectly interpretable and its depth depends on the question. By 'depth' I mean that whenever needed the model learns to break down the problem into simpler subproblems and solve them first.\r\nThe paper can be found at: arxiv..   \r\n     \r\nCDL is a library written in C++ implements algorithms explaind in the paper and tested on 32 small datasets\r\nDirectories included in the library\r\n-----------------------------------\r\n`CDL/`   - source code  \r\n`Dataset/`   - dataset divided into three groups (Group_A: 25 small datasets, Group_B: 5 small datasets,Group_C: 2 small datasets)   \r\n\r\n`results/`   \r\n* 3 outputFiles: contain MGICDs learned in each group of datasets and some statistics about training\r\n* 32 animation files that explain how MGICDs solve the test questions, they can be shown by calling `animate.py` but need first to to change the directory of the animation file in the first line, and you can also change the animation speed by changing the value of nodeTime\r\n* Most of CDs in the outputFiles can be displayed by `visualizeCD.py`, but need first to copy it to CD.txt\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n---------------------\r\nThis project is licensed under the terms of the MIT license\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n---------------------\r\nUsage\r\n---------------------\r\nTasks\r\n---------------------\r\nCode Overview\r\n---------------------\r\n\r\nExample : three one-digit numbers addition Group_B (dataset_2)\r\n---------------------\r\n![example1](GifFiles/Group_B_dataset_2.gif)\r\n\r\n<br><br><br>\r\n\r\nExample: reverse task Group_A (dataset_19)\r\n---------------------\r\n![example2](GifFiles/Group_A_dataset_19.gif)\r\n\r\n<br><br><br>\r\n\r\nExample: Group_B (dataset_3)\r\n---------------------\r\n![example2](GifFiles/Group_B_dataset_3.gif)\r\n\r\n<br><br><br>\r\n\r\nExample: Group_A (dataset_24)\r\n---------------------\r\n![example2](GifFiles/Group_A_dataset_24.gif)\r\n\r\n",
