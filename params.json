  "body": "# Common-Description Learning (CDL)\r\nThis is a new framework to learn simples patterns from a few number of examples and use them to learn complex ones. the learned models are perfectly interpretable and its depth depends on the question. What is meant by depth here is that\r\nwhenever needed, the model learns to break down the problem into simpler subproblems and solves them using previously learned models, CDL is written in C++ and tested on 32 small datasets\r\n\r\nThe paper can be found at: https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.00241   \r\n\r\n\r\nGroup_B (dataset_2): Three one-digit numbers addition\r\n---------------------\r\n![example1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BasemElbarashy/CDL/master/GifFiles/Group_B_dataset_2.gif)\r\n\r\n<br><br><br>\r\n\r\nGroup_A (dataset_19): Reverse task\r\n---------------------\r\n![example2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BasemElbarashy/CDL/master/GifFiles/Group_A_dataset_19.gif)\r\n\r\n<br><br><br>\r\n\r\nGroup_B (dataset_3)\r\n---------------------\r\n![example2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BasemElbarashy/CDL/master/GifFiles/Group_B_dataset_3.gif)\r\n\r\n<br><br><br>\r\n\r\nGroup_A (dataset_24): Comparing One Digit Numbers\r\n---------------------\r\n![example2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BasemElbarashy/CDL/master/GifFiles/Group_A_dataset_24.gif)\r\n\r\n# Code\r\nAll the code for this project is available at https://github.com/BasemElbarashy/CDL .\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n---------------------\r\nThis project is licensed under the terms of the MIT license",
